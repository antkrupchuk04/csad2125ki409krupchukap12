Project repo for the Computer systems automated design discipline with simple game development which includes the software and hardware parts.

Task is implementation simple "rock paper scissors" game using a Software part as a client and a Hardware as a server.

My student number is 12 so the game will be "rock paper scissors" and a config file format is INI.

The most probably that the Arduino UNO board will be used as a Hardware and Software will be developed on C programming language.
